# Django-CV-App

<h2>Project Description</h1>
I created this project in relation to a task I had been set on my Software Engineering Bootcamp.

The program uses lists, functions, reading / writing to files, and string handling.

Here was the task I was set by HyperionDev:

Compulsory Task
Follow these steps:
● Create a new project called mySite.
● Start an application called personal. Our end-goal will be to set up an
“about you” dynamic website.
● Create a template for your app that will display some information
about you.
● Render your template and map a URL to it.
● Render two additional HTML files that you have previously created and
set up URLs for them.
● Install your app, and set up a URL for it.
